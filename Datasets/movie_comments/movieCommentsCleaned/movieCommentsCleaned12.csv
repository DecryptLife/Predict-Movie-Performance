Because God created you, He loves you. You exist to glorify Him in a real relationship.Mankind has rebelled against God, choosing to live for ourselves instead of for Him. This rebellion, called sin, has come between us and God. This sin brings about brokenness in our personal lives, our relationships, and also our world. Not only has it separated us from Him and His perfect design, it also brings judgment and death.Because God loves us, He sent His only son Jesus to rescue us from our sins. The Bible says that ‚ÄúGod shows his love for us in that while we were sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8). Jesus lived a perfect life, died on the cross as payment for our sins, was buried, and rose again from the dead. His resurrection proves that God has accepted Jesus‚Äô sacrifice for our sins. Believe in Him and go to Jesus in faith and trust in Him and trust in Him for salvation and repent of your sins and He will hear from Heaven and forgive you of your sins and save you from all sin and from death and from the enemy and from the wrath of God that&#39;s against sin. (Romans 5,6,7,8, John 3:16, 1 John 1:9).

Obviously they&#39;re pretty skeptical of the guy until shit starts happening that they can&#39;t explain, unless it&#39;s some elaborate, sick prank. Also, it&#39;s kinda scary because I feel like &quot;billie&quot;&#39;s motive is to get the person to admit what they&#39;ve done, and until they do, they have to watch their friends crumble in front of them. The billie guy is going to torture them until he gets the answer he wants, and none of them are owning up to it. The people who try to leave or cheat whatever is supposed to be happening to them, I believe that&#39;s where we start seeing some deaths.<br><br>I&#39;m not the best at explaining my point but I hope this is understandable, and it seems like it has a lot of potential to be good!",feel like psycholog horror cours extrem happen sort teach lesson least imagin teach lesson kinda stuff post video go along bulli hurt badli road well other around also imagin log anyth feel trap whatev whoever threaten obvious pretti skeptic guy shit start happen explain unless elabor sick prank also kinda scari feel like quot billi quot motiv get person admit done watch friend crumbl front billi guy go tortur get answer want none own peopl tri leav cheat whatev suppos happen believ start see death best explain point hope understand seem like lot potenti good

2892,VW-F1H-Nonk,"The movie is basically a white-wash of British society.  In the TV version, the mole (based on Kim Philby)  explains his betrayal as hatred for the U.S. &amp; not love of communism or the Soviet Union.  He sees Americans &amp; their culture as vastly inferior to the British.  Consequently, he resents America&#39;s leading role in the West.    Essentially, he&#39;s a monumental, bi-sexual, snob who will put anyone at risk, including his lovers (which results in his undoing), in order to maintain his sense of Anglo superiority.   <br><br>In fact, double agent, Philby tried to spread disinformation on both sides in the hope that the U.S. &amp; the Soviet Union would destroy each other.
